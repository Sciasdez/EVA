## Compatibility data

This repo contains the data from the paper *So similar and yet incompatible: Toward the automated identification of semantically compatible words* (Kruzsewski and Baroni, 2015). The *preprocess.py* script reads the data to return only the pairs contained in the Visual Genome vocabulary.
